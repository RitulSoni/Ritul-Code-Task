# Code Modifications Documentation

This document lists the necessary code edits for improving security, dependency management, and overall codebase maintainability.

## Edit 1: Dependency Management

- **Objective:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary Python packages.
- **Details:** This file will include all the dependencies used in the project to facilitate easier setup and consistent environments across different setups.

## Edit 2: Secure API Key Management

- **Objective:** Securely manage API keys using environment variables.
- **Details:** 
  - Introduce the `python-dotenv` library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - Store the Cohere API key in the `.env` file to keep it out of the source code.
  - Update the `.gitignore` file to exclude the `.env` file from version control, ensuring that sensitive credentials are not exposed in the version history.

## Edit 3: Streamline Configuration and Environment Management

- **Objective:** Simplify and standardize the environment setup to enhance maintainability and ensure consistency across different development environments.
- **Details:**
  - **Dockerization:**
    - Create a `Dockerfile` that specifies the Python version, installs dependencies, and sets up the necessary environment for the application to run. This will ensure that all developers and the deployment environment are using exactly the same configurations.
  - **Miniconda Environment:**
    - Create a Conda environment file, `environment.yml`, that specifies all necessary Python packages and their versions. This approach is particularly useful for managing projects with complex dependencies.
    - A Conda env will ensure that the project dependencies are isolated and consistent across different machines and environments.

## Edit 4: Configuration Loading Change
- **Objective:** Enhance readability, reusability, and maintainability by centralizing configuration loading.
- **Details:**
    - **Centralize Configuration Loading:** Create a dedicated function to load the configuration file once and reuse it throughout the project. This reduces redundancy and potential errors from multiple configuration loads.
    - **Create a configuration loading function** in a common utilities module (e.g., `utils.py`):

   For example: 
   - **Old Code:**
    ```python
    with open('config.yaml', 'r') as file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(file)
    ```
   - **New Code:**
    ```python
    from utils import load_config
    config = load_config()
    ```
## Edit 5: Optimize Subtask Retrieval in `QuestionMuniPair`
- **Objective:** Improve the performance and efficiency of retrieving subtask details by implementing a caching mechanism.
- **Details:**
  - **Implement Caching for Subtask Details:** Modify the `get_subtasks` function to use a dictionary for caching subtask details. This cache will store subtask details once they are computed for a question ID, reducing redundant data processing on subsequent calls.
  - The edit aims to reduce computational overhead and improve response time, especially in environments with repetitive questions. This enhancement boosts system performance without adding significant complexity.


### Edit 6: Refactor and Optimize the `context_builder` Function

- **Objective:** Streamline and optimize the `context_builder` function for better performance and readability.
- **Details:**
  - **Modularize Complex Functionality:** Break down the `context_builder` function into smaller, more focused functions. For instance, separating the tree flattening, sorting, and reranking processes can make each step clearer and more manageable.
  - **Enhance Performance with NumPy:** Replace Python lists and loops with NumPy operations where possible, especially in functions like `sort_chunks` that perform calculations over arrays. This could significantly speed up the processing of embeddings.
  - **Efficient Keyword Handling:** Modify the `get_keywords` function to preprocess and cache keywords at the start rather than pulling from a DataFrame and processing them during each function call. This avoids redundant I/O operations and computations.

## Edit 7: Grouping function in gpt_functions
- **Objective:** Group related functions together under clear headings 
- **Details:**
    - (e.g., "File Management Functions", "Batch Processing Functions", "Embedding Functions", "GPT API Functions").
    - This helps readers quickly locate the relevant parts of the code.

## Edit 8: Simplify Complex Functions in gpt_functions
- **Objective:** Simplify complex functions by breaking them down into smaller, single-purpose functions.
- **Details:**
    - For example, in the `gpt_api_call` function, separate the logic for preparing the `messages_copy` from the actual API call.
    - This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Edit 9: Improve Specific Sections in helper_functionsV7
- **Objective:** Enhance readability and maintainability by applying specific improvements.
- **Details:**
    - **Simplify Complex Functions:** Split the `build_model` function into smaller helper functions for token limit and request limit checks. Improve error handling by using specific exception types.
    - **Enhance Documentation and Structure:** Add docstrings to each function explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Group related functions under clear headings (e.g., "File Operations", "Batch Processing", "Utility Functions").


## Edit 10: Overall Codebase Cleanup
- **Objective:** Perform general codebase cleanup to enhance readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices.
- **Details:** 
  - **Remove Unused Code:** Identify and remove any unused or redundant code snippets to declutter the codebase.
  - **Consistent Formatting:** Ensure consistent code formatting, such as indentation, spacing, and naming conventions, throughout the project.
  - **Docstrings and Comments:** Add or improve docstrings and comments to explain the purpose and functionality of functions, classes, and modules.
  - **Code Refactoring:** Refactor any complex or convoluted code sections to improve clarity and maintainability.
