# Code Modifications Documentation

This document lists the necessary code edits for improving security, dependency management, and overall codebase maintainability.

## Edit 1: Dependency Management

- **Objective:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary Python packages.
- **Details:** This file will include all the dependencies used in the project to facilitate easier setup and consistent environments across different setups.

## Edit 2: Secure API Key Management

- **Objective:** Securely manage API keys using environment variables.
- **Details:** 
  - Introduce the `python-dotenv` library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - Store the Cohere API key in the `.env` file to keep it out of the source code.
  - Update the `.gitignore` file to exclude the `.env` file from version control, ensuring that sensitive credentials are not exposed in the version history.

## Edit 3: Streamline Configuration and Environment Management

- **Objective:** Simplify and standardize the environment setup to enhance maintainability and ensure consistency across different development environments.
- **Details:**
  - **Dockerization:**
    - Create a `Dockerfile` that specifies the Python version, installs dependencies, and sets up the necessary environment for the application to run. This will ensure that all developers and the deployment environment are using exactly the same configurations.
  - **Miniconda Environment:**
    - Create a Conda environment file, `environment.yml`, that specifies all necessary Python packages and their versions. This approach is particularly useful for managing projects with complex dependencies.
    - A Conda env will ensure that the project dependencies are isolated and consistent across different machines and environments.

## Edit 4: Configuration Loading Change
- **Objective:** Enhance readability, reusability, and maintainability by centralizing configuration loading.
- **Details:**
    - **Centralize Configuration Loading:** Create a dedicated function to load the configuration file once and reuse it throughout the project. This reduces redundancy and potential errors from multiple configuration loads.
    - **Create a configuration loading function** in a common utilities module (e.g., `utils.py`):

   For example: 
   - **Old Code:**
    ```python
    with open('config.yaml', 'r') as file:
        config = yaml.safe_load(file)
    ```
   - **New Code:**
    ```python
    from utils import load_config
    config = load_config()
    ```


## Edit 5: Grouping function in gpt_functions
- **Objective:** Group related functions together under clear headings 
- **Details:**
    - (e.g., "File Management Functions", "Batch Processing Functions", "Embedding Functions", "GPT API Functions").
    - This helps readers quickly locate the relevant parts of the code.

## Edit 6: Simplify Complex Functions in gpt_functions
- **Objective:** Simplify complex functions by breaking them down into smaller, single-purpose functions.
- **Details:**
    - For example, in the `gpt_api_call` function, separate the logic for preparing the `messages_copy` from the actual API call.
    - This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

## Edit 7: Improve Specific Sections in helper_functionsV7
- **Objective:** Enhance readability and maintainability by applying specific improvements.
- **Details:**
    - **Simplify Complex Functions:** Split the `build_model` function into smaller helper functions for token limit and request limit checks. Improve error handling by using specific exception types.
    - **Enhance Documentation and Structure:** Add docstrings to each function explaining their purpose, parameters, and return values. Group related functions under clear headings (e.g., "File Operations", "Batch Processing", "Utility Functions").
