# Code Modifications Documentation

This document lists the necessary code edits for improving security, dependency management, and overall codebase maintainability.

## Edit 1: Dependency Management

- **Objective:** Create a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary Python packages.
- **Details:** This file will include all the dependencies used in the project to facilitate easier setup and consistent environments across different setups.

## Edit 2: Secure API Key Management

- **Objective:** Securely manage API keys using environment variables.
- **Details:** 
  - Introduce the `python-dotenv` library to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
  - Store the Co:here API key in the `.env` file to keep it out of the source code.
  - Update the `.gitignore` file to exclude the `.env` file from version control, ensuring that sensitive credentials are not exposed in the version history.
